# Demo Site

This is the open source code to test/build things that will go into the main site. All text/links/photos will be generic and will be edited to fit the main site if that block of code is used.

### index.html:
    1. Nav needs to be horizontal, not vertical. 
    2. "How to use the site" needs to be the 
        entire width of the page. There needs to 
        be space above and below it as it is it's
        own little section.
    3. The other sections need to be aligned 
        vertically on the page. Each section 
        should have about a paragraph's worth of
        information.
    4. In the footer, need to add a "see a problem?"
        type link that will redir to a fillable

        what the issue is.
            Issues can be things like misspelled 
            words, incorrect information, or 
            information that needs to be updated.
